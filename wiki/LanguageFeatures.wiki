#summary Describes the Python language features currently supported
Currently the situation is as follows. Note that development is going fast and features are quickly moving from "not supported" to supported.

= Supported =

  * Data types supported : int, float, double, ndarray.
  * User defined classes supported.
  * Functions supported.
  * For loop over range/xrange.

= Not supported =

  * Lists, dicts, tuples 
  * Multiple inheritance.
  * Keyword arguments.
  * Lambda
  * Exceptions
  * Decorators
  * Iterators and generators
  * Dynamic code execution
  * Metaclasses
  * Negative indices for ndarray.
  * Ufuncs
  * Dynamic redefinition of functions and classes etc.
  * Properties, staticmethod, classmethod, class attributes.
  * Magic methods such as __new__, __add__ etc.
  * "with" statement 
  * subclassing int, float, double or ndarray

= Broken. Being fixed =
  * Imports
  * While loop
